# Clustering-and-Similarity-Retrieving-Documents
This is part of project for Coursera course on Machine Learning


We are focusing on using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, by analyzing their text. We explored two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF

Also, we are going to dig deeper into this application, explore the retrieval results for various famous people, and familiarize ourselves with the code needed to build a retrieval system
